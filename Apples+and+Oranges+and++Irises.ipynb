    "This is our first look at using machine learning techniques to classify items. In this example, we have information about fruit, and we want to classify it as being an apple or an orange. The general idea is to use an existing (and powerful) machine learning data structure for prediction. In other words, given some information about a piece of fruit, can we accutately determine if its an apple or an orange?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major strategies for making predictions: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The majority of practical techniques are supervised, so we'll focus on those. There are many supervised learning models that are used for classifying information. Examples include:\n",
    "+ decision trees\n",
    "+ k Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\n",
    "+ Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "+ Neural Networks\n",
    "+ Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "+ Discriminant Analysis, etc\n",
    "In this example we use a machine learning data structure called a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, you have a 'training set' of data with a range of information about objects you want to classify (which we call features) PLUS an accurate classification for each one (which we call the label). \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Typically you divide this features/label dataset into two parts: a training dataset and a testing dataset\n",
    "+ You first use the training dataset with both features and labels to 'train' your machine learning data structure. \n",
    "+ Then you use the testing dataset with just the features and see what labels it produces\n",
    "+ Finally, you compare the predicted labels with the actual labels to see how accurate your machine learning data structure was\n",
    "\n",
    "One final thought- there are two categories of problems that we want to predict. The type of prediction being made can be either:\n",
    "+ list of discrete values: think type of fruit, next move on chess board, spam/not spam. These are called **classification problems**.\n",
    "+ a continuous range of values: think weight of a fish, dollar value of a stock, height of a tree . These are called **regression problems**."
